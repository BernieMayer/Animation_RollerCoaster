Operating this program:

Right Mouse - Zoom out
Left Mouse - Rotate the camera trackball right

F - Toggle between first person view and third person view

To run type:
make
./coaster

Description:

The roller coaster has 3 main phases

Lifting:
- In this phase the rollercoaster is being lifted up to its max height
and is going at constant velocity

Gravity Free Fall:
- After the coaster reaches it's max height it's speed will now be
decided by gravity

Deaceleration phase
-In this phase the rollercoaster is deaccelerating and will eventually
come to a stop


This code uses a Fresnet frame in order to construct the model matrix

A fresnet frame is made up of 3 vectors.

A normal, which is how the passengers of the coaster have to be aligned
so that they don't fall off the track

A Tangent, which indicates the direction that the roller coaster is going

A Binormal, which is the cross product of the normal and the tangent.
This vector is mainly used to determine where the tracks should be so
that the cart does not fall off
